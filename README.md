<h1> Probability Sampling </h1>
<h2>An implementation of the probability sampling methods using JavaFX</h2>
_______
<h3> a collaboration by Michael Loewe Alivio and Jace Roldan </h3>

<h3>About the code </h3>
***
It's essentially an MVC implementation of JavaFX: we used 4 different FXML templates to simulate the 3 kinds of probability sampling methods. We routed each FXML file and its corresponding components to a controller (FXMLDocumentController.java) which handled all the action events. To simulate the model, we used a naive implementation of the Simpleton Design Pattern.

<h3> Credits </h3>
We literally started off on the projects just two days after we had learned about basic JavaFX and FXML.
These sites really gave us a healthy boost of inspiration and help in coding.

We'd like to attribute some of the helpful code snippets to this site as well.

And of course, programmers can only do so much with plain documentation that sometimes we need virtual help. We'd like to extend our thanks to these guys for putting up an awesome tutorial.
